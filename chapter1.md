# Algorithms



A function, from a mathematical perspective, is an equation given some parameters equates an output.  Such that an input of three applied to the equation ((input) + 4) will yield a solution of seven.  

Programs are written using said functions to provide a containment for algorithms.  They help to provide structure and some times independence of other functions, as we will see later.
