# Variables


Variables are placeholders to store information. These are used in functions to reference information to distinguish between different types of variables and their values.


## Integer
The first type of variables is called an integer, which stores natural whole numbers (1, 2, 3, ... 100 ... infinity). The value that the computer can store depends on the hardware of the computer.

## Double
The second type of variables is called a floating or double which stores real numbers (0, .1, .2, .3, ... 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 ... infinity). As you can guess this value uses a decimal where as an integer does not.  The value given to a float does not need to have a decimal but will treat the number as if it did.  Such that given a number of 1 the program will treat it as 1.00. These two types of variables are not interchangeable in a lot of languages, so if you place an integer where you needed a double you will get the wrong answer.  Whenever in doubt use the type that has more precision, in this case it is the double.
